// Custom Capes
//
// Lets the player wear any PNG as a classic cape. The module owns a "capes"
// directory next to config.json (`<configDir>/capes`, created on first
// launch together with a sample cape); every .png file in it shows up as an
// option of the module's radio picker in the launcher mod menu.
//
// The selected file is decoded with stb_image and resampled onto the
// classic-cape layout of the 64x32 canvas Minecraft uses: the image is
// painted onto the outer back face only (x=1..11, y=1..17), the inner
// front face is filled with a flat lining color instead of a repeat of the
// image, and the top/bottom/side edge strips are continued from the image's
// edge colors so the 1-voxel-thick cape mesh does not look flat. The design
// is also mapped onto the tapered Elytra UV area used by both wings. Exact
// 64x32 inputs keep manually-authored Elytra pixels; if that area is empty,
// the wing fallback is generated from the cape face. The result is written
// into the local player's SerializedSkinImpl::mCapeImage each tick. Modern game versions
// only render the classic cape when SerializedSkinImpl::mCapeId is
// non-empty, so a synthetic short-string id is written alongside the image
// and restored together with it. The blob handed to the
// game is malloc'd and tagged with free() as its deleter, so whatever the
// engine does with the image afterwards (move, destroy, skin rebuild) is
// memory-safe. The original cape is restored when the module is disabled or
// "None" is picked.
//
// Memory safety notes:
//   * all patching happens inside the local-player tick, so the only skin
//     object ever dereferenced is one freshly resolved from the live player
//     pointer — a previous skin object can never dangle.
//   * when the skin object is replaced by the game, the old object owns the
//     blob we injected (freed by the engine through our deleter), so no
//     cleanup is needed on our side.
//   * the cape offsets are version-specific and derived from the verified
//     skin offsets (see include/bedrocktools/sdk/offsets/Skin.hpp); a sanity
//     check on the live skin image aborts the patch if the layout shifts.
//   * persona skins go through the persona pipeline (no classic cape image),
//     so the module leaves them untouched.
//   * on Leave World the engine detaches the player from its level
//     (Actor::mLevel goes null) before the player and skin are freed; the
//     tick hook bails on a null player or a null level link and detaches
//     its engine references WITHOUT touching the skin — the engine frees
//     the injected blob through its deleter tag, so a teardown tick can
//     never write freed memory or double-free the blob.
